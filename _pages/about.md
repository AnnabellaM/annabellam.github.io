I am a third-year Ph.D. student at The University of Texas at Dallas. My faculty supervisor is [Shiyi Wei](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~swei/). My research interest lies in program analysis and fuzz testing with the goal of enhancing the tools’ reliability and improving the explainability of their evaluation. One line of my work is to enhance the static analysis tools by automatically detecting nondeterministic bugs and diagnosing their root causes, as well as understanding the common challenges tool developers are facing through repository mining. Another line of my work is to improve methodologies for evaluating and introspecting fuzzers by developing new benchmarks and an interactive visualization framework for fuzzing, as well as a new automated introspection framework for fuzzers, to provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of fuzzing tools, and eventually enable researchers and practitioners to better understand how and why their fuzzers work or fail to work.
